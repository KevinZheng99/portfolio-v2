        My journey into the realm of development began in 2016, captivated by
        videos showcasing developers crafting intricately designed games
        single-handedly. Upon completing high school in 2017, I discerned my
        calling in software development, particularly focusing on web
        development. Over time, I have been fortunate enough to collaborate with
        exceptional professionals, contributing to the creation of software
        solutions for a non-profit organization and a start-up.

        I&apos;m currently focusing on imporving my abilities on buliding better
        software. Specifically improving on my design and expanding my knowledge
        on the tech side to be a better web developer.

        During my off time I love playing basketball with my friends,
        powerlifting, training for a marathon or I&apos;m tending to my crops
        and animals in Stardew Valley.
